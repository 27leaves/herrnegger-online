Over the course of the last month I took part in the Digital Writing course Ship 30 for 30. I have mixed feelings about my personal journey and in this essay I want to discuss my Learnings.

## Content & Community
I am amazed by the content that you get delivered in the course and the community the organizers built. They did a really amazing job with the preparation, with onboarding everyone to their system. I was amazed by how they were able to give so much value to so many people at the same time. That alone was worth the money for me. 

## My Personal Goals
It was never my goal to become a professional writer, to capitalize anything or market myself with online writing. The reason why I joined this course was that I just wanted to get pushed to publish. To overcome that perfectionism and getting more comfortable with sharing my own thoughts. I think I fully succeeded with that. I am proud of having now (almost) 30 pieces of content with my own thoughts and I even got some positive responses from my friends (one of my big fears why I was almost not doing the course)

## Surprising Things:

**I made some friends**: The energy in this community is amazing. I am now really happy to look get to know some of those great people. Thank you!

**I learned how to use Twitter**: How fast it can go to get into a Twitter community, to get to know people there and that you can really find a lot of interesting people there.

**I wrote an essay that got semi-viral**: That was an interesting experience and I also wrote about my learnings the next day.

**Sharing something on a daily basis is great**: For my own intellectual development it just felt good to have this daily habit and structure to constantly work in small steps towards a "better" me.

## My "Failures"
At some point "life got in the way" and I was not motivated to do all the live calls, watch all the content, get all of the information. I wasn't as active in the Circle community and on Twitter after a week or so and saw that when you put less time into it, also the views/impressions/likes/comments decrease. Social Media is just something that I consciously try to avoid in my life and although this community is as supporting as it gets, I got overwhelmed at one point and decided to step back for my own mental health. Looking back, it was probably the right decision at that point.

## My Skepticism
With some content of the course I was a bit skeptic. One thing was the pushing of Typeshare. I think it's cool that they build their own tool and of course it's their right to push it, but it made the content a bit less trustworthy. "Do not create a blog" is one of their big mantras. Is this really because you believe that or do you just want to push your own platform? I think both of them could be true and I don't want to ascribe something to them, but those are my skeptic thoughts.

*Update: Sean Oliver, my guide from the cohort [clarified this](https://twitter.com/Sean_Oliver/status/1490772541559873536):
> Before typeshare, there was a steep learning curve to using a Figma template to achieve the same image result. Itâ€™s still possible to do that. They simply reccomend a tool purpose built to make it easier.

## Conclusion
I'm very happy that I decided to sign up for this course. I'm thankful for all of you who made this such a nice journey and who were so supportive over the last month. Nonetheless, I decided to take those all those learnings and put it into another context. More on that tomorrow :)
