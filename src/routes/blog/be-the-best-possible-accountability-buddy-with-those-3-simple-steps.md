[In yesterday's essay](/blog/why-you-need-an-accountability-buddy)  you learned why having an accountability buddy can be very helpful to stick to your habits. Today I'll present a method with which you can support each other in the most effective way.

## Step 1: Set the goal

The first step is to define the goal.

-   It should be  **measurable and realistic**. Example: Instead of "I want to learn the guitar" say "I will play the guitar for at least 5 minutes a day".
    
-   Set a  **specific time**  when you will check in with each other. I would recommend every time immediately after finishing the task you write each other a message. A specific deadline for each day can also help.
    
-   **Push it to 100%:** After you defined your goal ask your buddy how confident they are with reaching their goal. With anything lower than 100% add some consequences to the challenge until they are 100% confident. Consequences can be positive or negative. Examples:
    
    -   **Positive consequence**: "If I reach your goal for 30 days in a row I will buy myself this new computer game"
        
    -   **Negative consequence**: "If I fail to practice one day I have to put 10â‚¬ into a pot which will be donated to cause X". If this is still not enough you could even consider donating the money to the political party you don't like.
        

## Step 2: Make a contract

Write down your goal as specific as possible and sign it with your buddy.

## Step 3: Be supportive

There is a possibility that your buddies will struggle at some point. Try to help them as well as possible, ask what could help them in their journey and support them along the way. It's usually way easier to stay motivated if you're positive and supportive instead of negative and blaming.
