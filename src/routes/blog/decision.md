So here I was. Lying in my bed with my thoughts going in circles for hours and hours. A feeling in my stomach spreading into the rest of my body I am well aware of - anxiety, fear of what the future may bring. I had to face a big decision.

But how could it come to this? Just the day before when I first read about it, it was fully clear that this could be something that I've waited for a long time. Something that filled my body with so much joy and optimism and when I talked to my friends about it there was no doubt that I want to do it. But at this time nothing was clear anymore. 

Often, those thoughts get clearer or dissolve on the next day. This one did not, as I had to face the decision in the next few hours. What's the worst thing that could happen? The day before I thought the worst thing that could happen is that I learn a skill for life and have a lot of fun during the journey. At this point I thought of my friends and family disagreeing with me, making fun of me and my opinions. On the other hand - my dear friend reminded me of this - do I make fun of people who make themselves vulnerable? Certainly not.

So there I was — accepting my fear — and finally signing up for the Ship 30 for 30 online writing course. And here I am now writing my first essay.
