A few years ago I faced another important decision. Do I want to finish my masters degree? When my therapist asked me that question, it struck me a bit. I mean, of course — that's what you're supposed to do, right? I won't quit now — so close to the finish line.

**So why haven't I done my thesis yet?** It was the only thing that was missing to finally hold that certificate in my hands, to celebrate my beautiful years in university with my family and friends and to get this heavy burden from my shoulders. Because that's how it felt in that moment. A big, heavy black hole that I did not know how to tackle. I did not know where to start.

**For years I waited for this idea for the perfect topic.** With that I can go to a professor and start. It should be something the world needs, something that fits to my values, something really meaningful. Sounds like a lot of pressure, right? And it was holding me back.

**I changed the first task** from having the perfect topic to writing to a professor. An Email that was done in 5 minutes. There was a lot of anxiety there before writing him, but I did it. And now I'm so happy that this is done.

**Recently, I found myself within those circles all over again.** Which topics do I want to write about? What does my perfect life look like in a year? No idea.

All this perfectionism just leads to procrastination. Let's show up and do.
