A couple of weeks ago I had an interesting thought. I think what many people don't understand is what people really mean when they want to take care about our environment. That we don't want to pollute the planet earth if it's not absolutely necessary and that we are willing to change our behavior in our best knowledge to protect nature and the earth.

Here is my thought: The Earth does not care at all about "the environment". What we care about is that in the future we still can live on this planet with all of its wonders and resources we need. If we can't manage to change and take care about "the environment", at some point we humans won't be able to exist here or at least a lot less humans than right now. Earth does not care about that, it will be probably regenerate pretty quickly after that.

What we really care about is us and our children. Humankind. So let's all work together and do our part in that.

PS: I know this is a very simplistic description of the problem and the solution. I just wanted to write down one thought and maybe provoke some thoughts about it in you.
