Yesterday **I read an essay of one of my fellow shippers** [**Mak Rahman**](https://twitter.com/mak_r_/status/1483814960597770247)  which was so  **special in a particular way** that is hard to describe: He wrote about that he was clearing out a drawer, found some old keys and what he would do with it. Please read it if you haven't.

It got me thinking.  **I love this essay and I think it's one of the most interesting ones that I've read so far**. I'd like to figure out why it has this effect on me and maybe this inspires some other essays:

-   **Not obvious**: He found an everyday situation and transformed what would probably be seen as a very unspectacular event into an idea for an essay.
-   **Narrative tension**: He found keys. What should he do with them now? "Throwing away keys just feels wrong."
-   **Relatable**: Everyone knows the feeling of finding old keys or any other old objects and putting them back where they were.

So what I think makes this piece of art so special is that he takes this topic and creates  **a relatable story in such few words**. It even has an open ending leaving you in a small discomfort of knowing that he'll probably find them again at some point. And what then? "These keys might stay with me till I die". It's like having hidden friends somewhere who will accompany you through your life. Some day maybe there might be a door that can be opened.

Even more what I also like about it is that  **it inspires to write about similar topics - everyday things, everyday situations that you would usually not write about**. I'll be extra attentive over the next days to find those hidden treasures.
