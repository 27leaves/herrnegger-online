In one of his latest videos, Ali Abdaal talks about an interesting approach how to think about time that he read in the book "Happy Sexy Millionaire" by Steven Bartlett:

> We have 16 waking hours every day times 7 =  **112 waking hours per week**. Imagine you're going into a casino and you're playing chips. And  **every time you go to the casino you have 112 chips to play with**. And  **every hour you have to allocate that chip to something**. You can't save it up - it's always going to be used.

This got me thinking. It's a way of viewing this abstract concept of time in a more concrete way.  **It certainly helped me thinking about my time more consciously**  and in some situations the concept lead me to a different decision: "Do I really watch another episode of this Netflix series? I already spent 2 chips on it today. Okay, I think that does not lead me to a more fulfilled life, let's checkout some  [JavaScript Frameworks](/blog/the-burden-of-a-javascript-developer)".

I hope this approach also helps you to be more intentional with your time.  **How will you use your next chip?**
