A few months ago I was listening to the Bren√© Browns audiobook "The Power of Vulnerability", in which she talks about the importance of Play and how it leads to higher states of productivity and creativity. There she talked about that Play has three elements:

-   It's **time spent without a purpose**
-   It's **something you don't want to end**
-   It leads to a **loss of self-conciousness**

When I heard about it I was alarmed that I could not find many things in my life that feel like play. On the other hand, it was a good opportunity for me to be more loving towards myself and allow myself to make more things that are not seen as productive by the rest of the world (like playing [Ori](https://www.orithegame.com/) on the Switch - highly recommend!).

**But it was not until recently** that I found myself playing with something I thought I lost the play a long time ago: programming. As this is my day job, I usually do this with a purpose in mind and usually it's also okay if it ends at some point. But at one day in the Christmas holidays I read about this new shiny framework (Javascript people, you know the feeling I guess) that I wanted to try and I started playing around with it and **hours and hours went into it and it was FUN**! I did not think that programming could ever feel like that anymore and in the end I even [released a little something](https://github.com/27leaves/elderjs-tailwind-starter) for other people that could be maybe useful for them.

I can highly recommend you to sometimes just **allow yourself** to do things because something just drives you towards this **without any purpose** and **have fun** with it. For me this was a really powerful experience.
