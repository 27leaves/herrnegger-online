Yesterday  [I wrote about the importance of sleep](/blog/prioritize-sleep)  and how it impacts almost every aspect in our life: our mood, our health, our stress levels, â€¦ the list goes on and on. I shared some of the  **tools that helped me the most in prioritizing my sleep**: Being consistent with your bedtime, getting enough sleep and avoid food, bright light, work and alcohol.

Today I want to expand on that list and hope that some of those tools might be helpful for you:

-   **Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours before you go to sleep**: The average half-life of coffee is between 4 to 6 hours. That means that when you drink a coffee at 12pm, you'll still have about a quarter of the caffeine in your body at 10pm. For me it works well to  _usually_  drink my last coffee until noon.
    
-   **Track your sleep**: A very impactful decision on my journey of prioritizing my sleep was to get a sleep tracking device. Some friends and coaches recommended me the  [oura ring](https://ouraring.com/)  and to see my sleeping times and sleep quality along some helpful tips on how to improve my exercise levels and sleep times makes a big difference.
    
-   **NSDR & Yoga Nidra**: If you have problems with falling asleep (in the middle of the night or when you need a nap) try this! Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest protocols such as Yoga Nidra guide you through a meditation that will bring you into a deep-resting state like when you sleep. I've used Yoga Nidra for the last months for my naps. Usually I fall asleep during the meditations, but that's also no problem - I feel much more refreshed afterwards. Just search for "Yoga Nidra" or "NSDR" on youtube for plenty of free videos.
