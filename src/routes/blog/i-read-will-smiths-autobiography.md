**Have you heard of Will Smith?**  What a silly question, I guess everybody knows him. In November 2021 he released an autobiography that he wrote together with Mark Manson (the author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck). I was not really familiar with his life and only knew him from the movies.

I think  **this was the first biography that I read**. And I have to say -  **it was an incredible ride**. To be fair — I listened to the audiobook. Still not sure if you can say "reading" there, but who gives a shit? And I would definitely recommend you to listen to the audiobook instead of reading the book because it's narrated by Will Smith himself and beautifully decorated with some rap music parts in between.

**It's one of the first books in a long time that I was enjoying so much that I was sad it finished at some point**. Also, if you read and liked Mark Manson's books you will recognize his writing style and also I feel like he brought in some of his wisdom.

And not to spoil anything here, but it this guy went through some really strong ups and downs and was able to take a lot of insights and lessons from those phases with a good portion of self awareness.  **Starting with discipline, failures, big life goals, relationships, his motivations and finally spiritual – there are so many good stories packed into this book**. I highly recommend you to read (or better listen to) Will.
