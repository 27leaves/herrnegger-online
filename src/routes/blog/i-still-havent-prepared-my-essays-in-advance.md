**Now I’m in trouble.**

While in the beginning all the good advice for the consistent publishing on the Ship30 community contained at least a bit of „prepare your articles in advance“, I still haven’t done it. That’s why today on our last official writing day I’m still on day 28/30 and  **that’s why now I’m writing this piece still hungover from the night before and after 3 hours of sleep**  in the train to my best friends birthday brunch.

**I’m still happy about the choice**  that I took my laptop with me and that I’ll publish something today. And I will also finish the 30 pieces tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, I promise!
