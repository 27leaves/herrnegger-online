Imagine walking for hours and hours and still the top of the mountain is not in sight. You don't even like hiking but your parents force you every time to walk with them, right? How can they be so mean every time? You did not want to go in the first place and now you just can't walk any further. It's over.

That's how I often felt in my childhood and youth. My parents loved hiking. Not only the small hills we have around Vienna — every few months we visited my relatives in the Alps and there are the real mountains — the huge ones.

So here I was standing and complaining to my dad and with his wisest parenting he told me one sentence:

> Just one more curve.

Okay, I gave in and slightly motivated to get behind the next turn I continued walking. And there it was — finally — no hut, no cross, no top? Just the path continuing. He blatantly lied to me! I was upset. But then he said it again: "Just one more curve". That kept me going until finally we reached the top and I was really happy that I continued walking so far.

We developed this inside joke and at every hike my brother and I started to saying the sentence to each other. Somehow it helped to imagine the goal is right around the corner and that kept us going.
