Yesterday evening I was invited to a friend and we had some very interesting conversations. After talking about our deepest inner secrets like love stories, trips to America and Star Wars we also talked about sleep and podcasts. We found out that  **all four of us listen to podcasts while falling asleep.**

I thought I might be one of the only people who need that.  **That's how it feels like â€” that i need this background noise**  to prepare my mind and my body for sleep. In the recent years, when I was alone and tried falling asleep there was always the feeling of something missing. I cannot really get to the bottom of what exactly it is, but  **it might be that I need it to distract myself even to fall asleep.**  As if TV, audiobooks and podcasts the whole day is not enough, I also need it to fall asleep. I mean, it makes sense. Another suspicion is that it's just a habit. Probably I don't really need it but I'm used to it so it feels wrong if I don't have a podcast while falling asleep.

Now that I think about it, I also listened to music with my brother while falling asleep when we were children. So maybe I have trained to do that for all my life. For me this is an interesting phenomenon. I will definitely explore more of this topic soon.  **Can you relate to that? Do you also need some music or podcast to fall asleep?**
