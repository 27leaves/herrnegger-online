**I will stop my daily writing.**

I'll tell you why. The experience of Ship 30 for 30 was an amazing experience for me and like I've written yesterday, I succeeded with all of my goals and even experienced some really nice side effects.

However, for me Ship30 never was about becoming a prolific writer. I've never really dreamt about being a thought leader or writing a bestseller book. It was about **overcoming perfectionism and procrastination**. It was meant to be a tool for self development to kick my butt in the morning and to be able to share my work in case I want to share it.

## Using the Sacred Hour

In the last days I had an idea that felt really great to me. I love this "sacred hour" that I set aside every morning before starting the rest of the day. From now on, **I want to use this hour for projects that are just for me**. This "Johannes Hour" should be reserved for:

* projects that challenge me intellectually (not exercise etc, I already do that),
* side projects that I had in mind for some time but I don't know if there is enough demand,
* hobbies that I want to pursue for a long time but haven't taken the time to

## Possible Projects

So there are a bunch of things that fall into those categories and some of those ideas that I have in mind:

* **Thought Leaders**: A webapp where people can put in useful/interesting quotes from podcast intervies, books etc. and connect them with certain ideas/concepts and people.
* **Read Books**
* **Music**: Play the piano, play the guitar, finally get a foot into music production (probably better to do this not in the morning when everyone else is sleeping)

## Daily Commitment

The first thing that I will work on is **my own website with a blog and possibly also some kind of tool that will allow me to track my daily commitment**. I will set aside about 10 minutes each day to **post the progress to Twitter**, so it won't be the last time you've heard of me my friends!
