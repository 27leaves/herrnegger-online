After  [my yesterday's explorations](/blog/listening-to-podcasts-to-fall-asleep)  into my thought about listening to podcasts while falling asleep, I made a quick research in the big world of the internet: apparently nothing speaks against putting your mind to sleep to a soothing voice of your phone. The general rule that appeared was:  **when it helps you fall asleep, do it**.

And there was the next question: While with some podcasts it was very easy to fall asleep, some other podcasts made it very hard â€”  **are there podcasts that are more helpful for falling asleep than others**? Usually I try to choose podcasts that have a lightweight content. So nothing that is filled with information that I really want to know. So I would choose "[Fake Doctors, Real Friends](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/)" over "[Huberman Lab"](https://hubermanlab.com/)  (although sometimes Donald Faison woke me up again with his hilarious laugh).

My little internet exploration also showed me that there are even  **podcasts specifically made for falling asleep**:

-   [Sleep With Me](https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/)
    
-   [Deep Energy Podcast](https://podbay.fm/p/deep-energy-20-music-for-sleep-meditation-relaxation-massage-and-yoga)
    
-   [Nothing Much Happens](https://www.nothingmuchhappens.com/)
    
-   [Tracks To Relax](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tracks-to-relax-guided-sleep-meditations/id834515877)
    
-   [Audible Bedtime Stories](https://www.audible.com/ep/sleep-bedtime-stories-member-benefit)
    

And there are many more. Unfortunately I haven't tried them yet, but I'll definitely listen to some of them over the next weeks. Maybe you can also benefit from them, let's try them together?
