In the last 15 years I lived through a lot of different phases. Priorities went from studying, partying, meeting friends to getting my health on track, handling my psyche, not being tired all the time.

I'm embarrassed to say that only half a year ago  **I learned how important sleep is for every aspect of your life,**  when I discovered the phenomenal podcast of  [Andrew D. Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/master-your-sleep-and-be-more-alert-when-awake/). Prioritizing my sleep with the helpful tips he provided in the podcast had many recognizable effects:  **My mood got better, I was more productive at work and I feel sick less often.**

## How you can prioritize your sleep

Here are the tools and methods that helped me the most:

-   **Get your ~8 hours**: Take the time when you naturally wake up (for me 7am) and count back around 8-9 hours for your ideal time to go to sleep.
-   **Be consistent**: Always go to bed within the same timeframe of 30-60 minutes. Your body learns your times and will be most refreshed after a few days of your new "sleeping practice".
-   **Avoid:**
    -   **Bright light and screens (2h before sleep)**: Your body thinks that light from above is sunlight.
    -   **Food (3h before)**: Food will bring your heart rate up which is bad for your sleep.
    -   **Work (3h before):** You need some time to wind down before going to bed.
    -   **Alcohol**: Do I have to say anything more?

## If you miss a day

**What if you don't want to miss out on event XY?** Personally I handle it like that: When I decide to prioritize social life, I  **just get back into the rhythm on the very next day**.
