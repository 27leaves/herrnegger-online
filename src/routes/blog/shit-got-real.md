Okay, I get it now. That's what you meant when you said it will be always the content you least expect that will blow up. Yesterday I wrote a little piece of content. Still not sure I would call it an essay. And it had more reactions with less words than any other essay I've written so far.

**I want to be honest with you.** Right now I constantly check twitter for new likes and comments. It feels good to have written something that people can relate to that much. I can really feel the craving for those little dopamine spikes every time. 

**I'm really thankful and grateful** for your responses. It's just important for me to separate a few things for my own mental health. So here I want to leave a friendly little reminder for myself, who could be basically also you:

* **Don't get over your head.** This was luck. Yes, I saw there was a slight chance that something like this might happen, but it was mainly just laziness. 
* **Don't let it define your self-worth.** Yes, it's okay to feel excited right now, but you'll write other things again which are way more important to you and will create a lot less attention. You're a wonderful human no matter how much eyeballs your stuff gets.
* **Learn from the experience.** What's cool is, now you have some more data. For me it was that I wrote one thing that a lot of people in a specific community could relate to very well.
* **Never forget why you started in the first place.** Give yourself the permission to explore other topics and other formats. Stick to the plan, in the end nobody cares.
