Today is such a day. I woke up an hour late, it's already past my "sacred hour" that I planned for writing and I'm  **sitting in front of a blank page**  scrolling through my list of topics.  **Nothing really clicks today**  nor it's really clear what I want to write about there. So that this does not happen again tomorrow, I'll  **collect some ideas that could help me for tomorrow**:

-   **Choose the topic on the day before:** When you set down to write it should be already clear what you're writing about. Your mind already had several hours to think about it and now it's only about putting words out of your head.
    
-   **Make some research:** When you're like me you this list with topics that seem to be very interesting, but you're not really confident to write about those topics. Make some time to research those topics and to fill them with notes.
    
-   **Go through inspiration lists:** If you think that you're not ready to write about those things on your list, maybe some a list with topic inspiration can help.
    

Ok that's all I got for now. But I hope this should be enough for the next days. I think most important is that you (which is myself in this case) make time before sitting down to write to get the idea, decide on the idea and do the research.
