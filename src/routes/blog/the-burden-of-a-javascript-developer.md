And it happened again. I just could not resist.  **Like the alluring Sirens singing their seductive song to Odysseus â€” only this time they sing about a new JavaScript framework** I should try.

If you don't come from the web development world you have to know that this is a regular thing. The range of libraries and frameworks on the market is so huge that you probably need a few lifetimes to grasp everything. And it grows.  **Every day there are thousands of developers working on their own little new library or framework**  that fits exactly their needs and that they need to present to the world.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing, there is progress in the JavaScript landscape. But for us developers,  **one of our most important jobs is to refrain from this constant FOMO**  on new stuff. If you're constantly checking out on the latest things, there is no time of actually building your stuff.

**I got pretty good at that**. At goodbag they already had a working app when I joined so this decision was already made. And although I knew different options that I wanted to try more, I am very happy today that this decision was taken from me.

Over the last days I was finding myself again flirting with this new attractive framework.  **But this time I'll follow the voices of the Sirens**. Sometimes it's just fun to play and get your feet into new fields. Who knows what can be found there? And maybe,  **just maybe it will be the perfect one. The one my heart was longing for such a long time**. And then it will be the last one I will ever try.
