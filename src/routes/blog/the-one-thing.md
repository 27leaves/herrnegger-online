In his book *The One Thing*, Gary Keller presents a wonderful and simple idea of prioritizing a single task.

> What's the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?

I think this is such a powerful question you can ask yourself every day. To be honest, I did not read the book, but I first heard the principle in a [flow training](https://www.thrivex.eu) (not sponsored) and I made my own experiences with it. I think it is **one of the most effective methods** I tried that helped me **over a long period** of time and it's also easy to get back to when you missed some days.

I would suggest that **you allow yourself to be satisfied after this one thing**. So every task on top of this one task is only a bonus for the day and as such it feels like a "good", a "successful" day. At least in the context of work.

And this is where the fun comes in. When I first heard about the topic I thought: "Okay, but life's not only work, right?" The good thing is that you can apply this principle also to other contexts:

* **Relationships**: Maybe that one hard conversation might bring you closer again and everything else will be easier or unnecessary.
* **Exercise**: Maybe going for a short walk might get you in a better mood and everything else will be easier or unnecessary.
* **Mental Health**: Maybe focusing on less than on more will make everything else easier or unnecessary? (heh - like the one thing - got it?)first place.** Give yourself the permission to explore other topics and other formats. Stick to the plan, in the end nobody cares.
