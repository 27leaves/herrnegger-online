A week ago, I haven't published anything on the internet for a long time. One reason that was holding me back was that I just did not know where to start. I have so many interests: web development, app development, psychology, philosophy, productivity, photography, sports, … the list goes on and on… 

## I heard the same thing over and over: You need to focus on one niche in the beginning.

The main argument is that if someone likes one article of you and looks at the other articles of you, they are much more likely to follow you if they find other similar stuff that interests them. That makes sense. I think that's a really helpful advice if your goal is to collect followers and build a user base. 

## But what if you don't know what your niche is that you want to pursue?

The experience I made was that **it creates a lot of pressure and leads to procrastination**. At some point I had a thought: **It's okay to pursue multiple interests and it's okay to write about different topics**. This thought felt so liberating and lead me to write here today. About just anything that crosses my mind.

## My learnings

* It's okay to pursue multiple interests. If your goal is to just create a writing habit and overcome perfectionism, **allow yourself to just write and have fun along the way.** 
* Any advice should be taken with a grain of salt. It might be the perfect advice at some point, but **evaluate if the advice is helpful right now.**
