A few years ago I made this awesome experience in a meetup group with a strong self-development focus. One part of the meetup every Saturday was to get together in groups of 2-3 people and each one stating one thing that they want to achieve in the following week. Over the course of the next week we checked in with each other and helped ourselves stick to our new behaviors.

That was the first time I learned about the power of an accountability buddy. Here are my top reasons why you should consider this if you want to stick to a habit:

-   **"Will I do it today?" is just no valid question anymore.** As soon as you tell someone else there is a social commitment and it tricks your brain into actually doing the stuff because else your peers will not be happy with you.
    
-   **Small changes over time can lead to big changes in the future**. When we met the following week, we made the same thing again and usually there were new habits stacked on top of each other. "Going to sleep at 11:30pm" sometimes resulted in "Going to sleep at 10pm, waking up at 6, doing this crazy exercise [â€¦and so on]".
    
-   **You can support each other and exchange feedback**. When you have challenges along the way, you can discuss it with your buddies and probably they can bring you forward.
    
-   **It's just more fun.** Working on yourself and sticking to habits can be really hard and frustrating on some points. Doing it together with other people makes the whole journey much more enjoyable.
    

Now that you know why this might be a good idea, I will write about how to best hold yourself accountable with your buddy in my next essay.
