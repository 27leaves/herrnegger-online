Two weeks ago a friend of mine told me about a challenge he faces. He has a very important exam that he needs to prepare for, but usually he does not start learning until a few days before when it’s almost too late.  **I just wrote an essay about accountability buddies**  at exactly that day,  **so I asked him if he wants to do some kind of accountability with me.**

We made the deal that every day he will write me a message as soon as he has learned for 2 hours. He also added a workout every day. An important note is that he’s allowed to have 2-3 skip days within the ~30 days of the challenge. With that it makes it easier to stick to it in the long run.

**For me has been a great experience so far**. You should definitely also help a friend with reaching their goals and here are the reasons:

## Reason #1: It’s fun

Helping someone achieving their goals is a very satisfying experience.

## Reason #2: It’s motivating

Because of his persistence, he also motivates me to stick to the writing habit. So by holding him accountable, he is unknowingly also holding me accountable which is a nice side-effect that I did not think of.

## Reason #3: It’s fulfilling

You help your friends reaching their own goals. This is something really fulfilling and they also will be grateful for that.

## Reason #4: It’s easy

Of course that also depends how persistent your friend is and how active you have to be. With this friend, I don’t really have to do much. I don’t even think about it and on the next morning when I turn on the phone I have his message.
