You are not important.

No no, please don't feel attacked. I just write down a thought that I had a couple of weeks ago. Right now this thought feels depressing also for myself, but I swear, it was a really uplifting thought.

Let me reconstruct. I listened to the Tim Ferriss Show with Tim Urban from Wait but Why. If you don't know it yet, I can really recommend. I want to take one particular example that he stated.

Imagine aliens read a book of the last 100,000 years of humankind in a book of 700 pages. The first 690 pages nothing much happens, then suddenly religions, countries, telescopes, discoveries, so much is happening!

> Suddenly, on Page 700, we go to the space station. We have the moon. We have airplanes. We have cars just on Page 700. So, 699 pages, we only [...] have this kind of simple transportation, communication. Now, we have Face Time. We have telephone. We have the internet. Crazy. Less than a billion people for the first 699 pages. On Page 700 alone, we cross the one, two, three, four, five, six and seven billion person marks.

Somehow this made me realize how small we are. How in the great scheme of things we're absolutely not important. So liberating. No matter what you do, probably in 200 years no one will care about this. So don't beat yourself up for every mistake you made or every thing you did or did not do.
