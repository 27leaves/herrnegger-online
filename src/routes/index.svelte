<h1>Hi, I'm Johannes!</h1>
<p>I am a software developer, thinker and photographer.</p>
<p>Currently my goal is to develop this website in public, so everything you see is pretty raw and work-in-progress. I'm really excited to watch this thing grow and get feedback along the way. You can follow the progress along on <a href="https://twitter.com/27leaves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/27leaves/herrnegger-online" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github</a> and hopefully also soon here.</p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about personal development and psychology and will also write about that from time to time.</p>
<p>That's it for today, this will probably change soon :D</p>
